**Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?**

Using the coupons.csv dataset, the assignment was to run several tasks as outlined in the assignment.
Additionally, each member of the cohort was directed to run further investigations against the dataset that was of interest to him or her.
For this portion of the assignment I dug deeper into coupon utilization by educational attainment.
At a very high-level, the data analysis clearly state that although some educational levels have very high coupon redemption rate, that category of customer is not the best audience for targeting.

Please see the 'Bond_Module5_CouponUtilizationv2.1' file for all the details and summary.
